# Kweku Ananse — Interactive Retelling

This project is an interactive retelling of Kweku Ananse designed for my CLASS 2604 Greek Mythology final project.

Files:

- `index.html` — main entry (open in your browser)
- `styles.css` — visual styling
- `main.js` — simple scene engine plus optional speech narration
- `assets/spider.svg` — decorative spider logo

How to run:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `open index.html` on macOS).
2. Click "Begin" to start the interactive tale.

Narration:

- Click "Toggle Narration" to enable browser voice narration (Web Speech API).
- Use the voice selector and rate slider to pick a voice and speaking speed. If your browser lacks built-in voices, install or enable system voices or use the browser's default.

Notes for submission:

- The site preserves core motifs: trickster intelligence, spider imagery, and storytelling as a form of power.
- Variants are included via branching choices (help / steal / scheme) that alter consequences.
